# Website about AI Generated Images
HTML / CSS Portfolio Project

I started off by building the HTML structure.
My idea is to have the direction of the webpage as a column with each element of the page on top of each other
in a centered fashion.

On the index.html page it will hold information regarding what AI generated images are and how they work
accompanied by a YouTube video which can be played at the users command. 

CSS style page has been set up and i've tested my selectors were working correctly by adding background colours to the core sections to see if I have targeted them correctly. 

I've added font awesome script to the bottom of the index.html and on the CSS i've added a wildcard selector to remove any default stylings which may cause me issues with the layout further down the road as the project progresses. 

I am attempting at getting a base structure to the index.html, gallery.html and signup.html prior to my meeting with my mentor on 21st February. Given work commitments and attempting to balance work, family and social life this deadline may be rather tight. 

As I make changes and develop the website I will 'git add .', 'git commit -m', 'git push' on a regular basis
Currently the README. will be for note taking for when I have the 1-2-1 with my mentor. 

My goal for the project is to have 3 pages with the main bulk of the information being on the index.html. Gallery.html will hold X amount of AI generated images as examples for the user to view and finally signup.html will have a form on for users to use to signup to a newsletter all about AI Generated Images which will be updated monthly 'theoretically'.
